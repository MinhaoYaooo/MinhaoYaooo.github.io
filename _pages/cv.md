## Software
### [CoxMDS](https://github.com/MinhaoYaooo/CoxMDS)
An R package that provides a finite-sample FDR control for high-dimensional mediation analysis with a survival response using the multiple-data-splitting strategy.
### [MR-SPI](https://github.com/MinhaoYaooo/MR-SPI)
An R package that conducts two-sample Mendelian randomization by first selecting valid genetic instruments and then performing robust post-selection inference.
### [CoxMKF](https://github.com/MinhaoYaooo/CoxMKF)
An R package to apply the aggregation of multiple knockoffs to perform high-dimensional mediation analysis with a survival response using Cox-proportional hazards model.

I am currently a Research Fellow at the **Centre for Biomedical Data Science, Duke-NUS Medical School** in Singapore (Dec 2025 - Present).

Previously, I completed my PhD in Biostatistics in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at **The University of Hong Kong (HKU)**. I hold a Master of Data Science from HKU and a Bachelor in Economics from Peking University (PKU).

My research focuses on **Causal Inference** (Mendelian randomization, mediation analysis), **High-dimensional Statistics** (variable selection, knockoff methods), **Statistical Genetics** (multi-omics data integration), and **AI for Science** (deep learning tools for biological molecules).
